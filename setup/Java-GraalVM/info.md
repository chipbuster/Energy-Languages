Java GraalVM
===

Note: the version of this test is not provided in the published paper or any of 
its supplemental materials. However, evidence from the git repo very strongly
suggests that the version is "CE Java8 20.0.0".

This version of the GraalVM was released in 2020, making it unlikely that it
was part of the original benchmark set. For that reason, I will not install
it in this version of the repository, though this may change for future
installation scripts.
