Typescript
===

Version: Unknown (but using 2.3.1)
Path: /usr/local/src/node-v7.9.0-linux-x64/bin/tsc

Project Link: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
Download Link: N/A
Prerequisites: N/A
Installation Notes:

These are downloaded and saved via NPM. (No download link)
A zipped copy of the `node_modules` directory is included in case
offline installation is needed.


Other: The authors did not include a typescript version, instead just
re-listing the nodejs version (which is useless, because TS can compile
to multiple versions of JS/Node).

Based on [timestamps on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tags?after=v2.3.3), 
the earliest version of tsc that could have gone with the node 7.9.0 release
on April 11 2017 is the 2.3.1 release, so I will use that.

This install is dependent on the JavaScript install having completed (for npm access)
